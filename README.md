Thebe is a set of libraries allowing web applications and static web pages to provide interactive computation backed by a Juptyer kernel. It is organized in multiple libraries to allow it to be used flexibly in different web contexts.

Thebe comprises the following packages (located in the `packages/` folder in this repo):

- [`thebe`](packages/thebe) - a browser bundle providing the same high level functionality found in earlier versions of `thebe`. Add the js & css bundles to your webpage, along with configuration information and make code cells editable, executable and interactive.
- [`thebe-core`](packages/core) - a typescript library shipped as esm/cjs/browser-bundle providing access to low level runtime objects and functions for working with Jupyter Servers, Sessions, Notebooks and Cells.
- [`thebe-lite`](packages/lite) - a drop in typescript library shipped as a browser bundle that can be side-loaded alongside `thebe-core` that adds a [`jupyterlite`](https://github.com/jupyterlite) server for WASM based kernels.
- [`thebe-react`](packages/react) - a typescript library providing React hooks and provider components for using `thebe-core` functionality within React applications.

## Documentation

The latest thebe documentation is build using [mystmd](https://mystmd.org) and is [hosted here](https://mystmd.org/docs/thebe).

## Demos

The demo page from `apps/simple` are hosted [here on github pages](https://executablebooks.github.io/thebe) which let's you check out the interactivity that the top level `thebe` library provides along with `thebe-lite` for JuptyerLite based `pyodide` kernel access.

### Note for build with elFinder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oeway/pyodide-kernel/
# node -v
# v20.9.0
npm install
npm run quickstart
# jlpm build:prod 
```

Now for this repo (under root folder):

```bash
cd packages/lite
npm install
npm install file:../../../pyodide-kernel/dist/jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel-0.1.0.tgz
npm install file:../../../pyodide-kernel/dist/jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel-extension-0.1.0.tgz
cd ../../
npm run build
sh fetch-elfinder.sh

# In another terminal
cd apps/simple
npm run build
npm run start
```
